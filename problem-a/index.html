    <h1>A fictional character that I admire is <em>Mulan</em></h1>

    <p> <strong>Description</strong> </p>

    <p>
        Mulan is a Disney princess that is brave and self-reliant. Mulan is specifically a warrior, unlike a lot of other princesses. 
        Wanting to protect her country and family, she makes the decision to disguise herself as a man to take her father's place in
        the army. Mulan emphasizes the importance in standing up for what you believe is right, family, and being proud and embracing
        the culture/background you came from.
