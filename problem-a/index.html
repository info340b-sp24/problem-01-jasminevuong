    <h1>A fictional character that I admire is <em>Mulan</em></h1>

    <p> <strong>Description</strong> </p>

    <p>
        Mulan is a Disney princess that is brave and self-reliant. Mulan is specifically a warrior, unlike a lot of other princesses. 
        Wanting to protect her country and family, she makes the decision to disguise herself as a man to take her father's place in
        the army. Mulan emphasizes the importance in standing up for what you believe is right, family, and being proud and embracing
        the culture/background you came from.

    <p> <strong>Why I admire Mulan</strong> </p>

    <p>
        I admire Mulan because growing up I rarely got to see asian representation when watch TV. So by seeing a whole Disney princess
        that had the same cultrual background was empowering to see. She was my favorite princess growing up because of seeing how strong
        and resilient she was and seeing how proud of where she came from.
