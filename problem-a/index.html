        <strong>Description</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        Mulan is a Disney princess that is brave and self-reliant, where Disney made an animated film, named
        <a href="https://w.wiki/3ijL">Mulan</a>, about her. Mulan is specifically a warrior, unlike a lot of other princesses. 
        Wanting to protect her country and family, she makes the decision to disguise herself as a man to take her father's place
        in the army. She emphasizes the importance of standing up for what you believe is right, family, and being proud and 
        embracing the culture/background you came from.
